\section {Introduction}

Verigraph is a verification service (based on JSON) that can receive a description of a network topology and of security network function (NSF) configurations and that can analyze the given input in order to check if some reachability policies (e.g. the possibility for packets of a certain flow generated by a certain node of the topology graph to reach another node) are satisfied or not. \\
\newline
In this project, the main contribution to the Verigraph system has been the extension of the policy verification service. Based on the work of the netgroup, the service has been improved by allowing the user to define his own custom reachability policy and by providing a more in depth analysis of the chains of service functions that satisfy (or don't satisfy) the given policies.
\\
This required both the extension of the existing data format representations (XML and JSON), the design and the implementation of new resources for the restful API, and the modification of the existing web client used to communicate with the server. \\
Furthermore, the existing XML and JSON representations has been upgraded by adding additional constraint and by improving the reuse of existing elements.

\subsection {Folder Structure}

The files and folders described here are not the full set of documents that compose the Verigraph folder, but simply the ones that has been modified during the project. 

\begin{itemize}
 \item examples/ - Example graph configurations that can be loaded into the web client to test the reachability policies
 \item jsonschemas/ - JSON schemas that are used to validate the information received by the web client or loaded from a file
 \item schema/ - XML schema that is used to generate the JAXB classes used to model the different elements of the service
 \item src/ - Java classes
	\begin{itemize}
		\item it/polito/neo4j/ - Packages used for handling the storage of the graph into neo4j or to retrieve the graph information from neo4j
 		\item it/polito/verigraph/deserializer - Deserialize a JSON representation to a model object
